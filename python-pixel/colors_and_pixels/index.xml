Actually, computers have RGB mode to represent colors.
RGB format In python, we follow a specific format while defining colors: (R, G, B), where &amp;ldquo;R&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo; are all integers. &amp;ldquo;R&amp;rdquo; represents some amount of red, &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo; represents some amount of green, and &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo; represents some amount of blue.</description></item><item><title>Pixels on Image</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/colors_and_pixels/pixel-on-image/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/colors_and_pixels/pixel-on-image/</guid><description>Pixels Pixels is a small area of color on a display screen. Images are formed by pixels on the screen. We can manipulating pixels by changing the RGB Value, which are essentially changing the value of red, green and blue color on each pixels. When we see the an image on the screen, it is made of huge numbers of tiny pixel. Each tiny pixels has its only unique position and color it displays.</description></item><item><title>Access pixels on image</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/colors_and_pixels/access-pixel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/colors_and_pixels/access-pixel/</guid><description>We have already learned how to make an pure color image using pixels and change a pixel on the image. Then, we will learn how to make additions based on the existing images.
