#This is the example for creating a colorboard. from PIL import Image img = Image.new(&amp;#39;RGB&amp;#39;, (60, 30), &amp;#39;red&amp;#39;) img.save(&amp;#39;pil_red.png&amp;#39;)
Create your own colorboard! Choose your favorite and make a color board to play with! Here are some example colors you can choose from, you can also find your own color.</description></item><item><title>Activity 2: Modify your color board</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-2/</guid><description>Example one: Make a diagonal #This creates the original colorboard. from PIL import Image img = Image.new(&amp;#39;RGB&amp;#39;, (60, 30), &amp;#39;red&amp;#39;) img.save(&amp;#39;pil_red.png&amp;#39;) #This uses nested while loop to change the picture. x = 0 y = 0 while x &amp;lt; 10: while y &amp;lt; 20: img.putpixel( (x,y), (0, 0, 0)) x += 1 y += 1 img.save(&amp;#39;pil_red.png&amp;#39;) This is the picture before changing.

You can design your own logo or anything you want on this color board. Here is an example we provided for you.
Example: make an N. #This creates the original colorboard. from PIL import Image img = Image.new(&amp;#39;RGB&amp;#39;, (60, 30), &amp;#39;white&amp;#39;) #This uses nested while loop to change the colorboard. #Left vertical line for x in range(10, 15): for y in range(5, 25): img.</description></item><item><title>Activity 4: Create Basic Filter</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-4/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-4/</guid><description>We have already talked about that the image on the screen is made of pixels. Now we can start to learn how to design your own filter on the image. Let us see some examples on how to design a basic filter on your image.
Example for blue filter We want to add a blue filter on the cute cat above. Let's observe how to achieve that. #We need to import PIL package to manipulation with pixels.</description></item><item><title>Activity 5: More advanced filters</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-5/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-5/</guid><description>In the last section, we saw an example on creating a blue filter and thought about how to create the grey filter. Now, let us create our grey filter together.
Example - Create a grey filter Let us change the origin cat below with our grey filter together!!! (Hint: We changed the 10th code and achieved the grey filter.)

Example - Crop cat into half Now, let us crop out the right half of the cat image #We need to import PIL package to manipulation with pixels. from PIL import Image #Open the cat image img = Image.open(&amp;#34;cat.png&amp;#34;) width=img.size[0] height=img.size[1] #Set up a new image with the half width and height newimg=Image.new(&amp;#39;RGB&amp;#39;,(width//2,height) ) #Set the pixel for the new image for i in range(width//2): for j in range(height): # For every row color = img.</description></item><item><title>Activity 7: Change the background of image</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-7/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-7/</guid><description>In this section, we will start to learn how to change the simple background of your image using pixels.
Example - Change background color Let us change the background color of Nuvi into pink from PIL import Image #Open the cat image img = Image.open(&amp;#34;nuevo.png&amp;#34;) width=img.size[0] height=img.size[1] #Set up a new image with width and height newimg=Image.new(&amp;#39;RGB&amp;#39;,(width,height) ) #Set the pixel for the new image colorpink=(244,114,208) coloryellow=img.getpixel( (0,0) ) for i in range(width): for j in range(height): color = img.</description></item><item><title>Activity 8: Flip your image</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-8/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-8/</guid><description>In this section, we will start to learn how to flip your image using pixels.
Example - Flip your image up-side-down Let us flip the cute cat up side down. Flip the image up-side-down is same as creating a symmetrical image with respect to the horizontal central line, which is the black line in the following image.
#We need to import PIL package to manipulation with pixels. from PIL import Image #Open the cat image img = Image.</description></item><item><title>Activity 9: Rotate your image</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-9/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-9/</guid><description>In this section, we will start to learn how to rotate your image using pixels.
Example - Rotate your image 180 degree clock-wise Let us rotate this cute cat 180 degree clock-wise. #We need to import PIL package to manipulation with pixels. from PIL import Image #Open the cat image img = Image.open(&amp;#34;cat.png&amp;#34;) width=img.size[0] height=img.size[1] #Set up a new image with the half width and height newimg=Image.new(&amp;#39;RGB&amp;#39;,(width,height) ) #Set the pixel for the new image for i in range(width): # For every col for j in range(height): # For every row # Focus on how we get our heighNew.</description></item><item><title>Activity 10: Challenge: Make your own image</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-10/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-10/</guid><description>In this section, we will use all kinds of methods to make your own picture. In this section, you are free to make any combinations of basic colorboard, drawing elements, filters, cropping, flipping or changing colors.
Challenge - Make your own image In the following repl.it, we provide you some images you can play around with, you are also welcomed to add your own images.
Be careful: In order to see your image, please click on top left corner (which says &amp;lsquo;Files&amp;rsquo;), and then click on the image file to see the result.</description></item></channel></rss>
