Conditional statements allow the computer to make decisions based off the value of an expression. In the real world, we use conditional statements all the time to make decisions! For example, if it is raining outside, then I use an umbrella. In this example, the I evaluated the weather outside and because it was raining, I made the sequential decision to use an umbrella.</description></item><item><title>Loops</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-basics/conditional-statements-loops/loops/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-basics/conditional-statements-loops/loops/</guid><description>Loops in Python If you want to repeat a task multiple times, Python has a way to do that easily using loops. There are two types of basic loops in python: for loops and while loops.
For loops For loops iterate over a sequence. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you wanted to repeat a simple task 5 times. Here is how you would do it.
The following for loop iterates through each of the numbers in the list [1,2,3,4,5], and assigns the value x to it.</description></item></channel></rss>
