### Make your program talk to you!

**Print** statements are used to print something on the console. Use `print("Hello World")` to print *Hello World* in the output screen. We will later learn that print is a function and we use it to perform a print job. Whatever you pass to the `print` function is printed on the screen.
    {{% notice %}}
    print("Hello World")
    {{% /notice %}}
