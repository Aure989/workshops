In this lesson, you will learn how to make a robot move to the sound of a clap.

Before we start learning how to program our robots, we need to answer these two questions:
1. What is a robot?
A robot is a machine that resembles a living creature as it is able to move independently and perform complex actions
2. How do robots know what actions to take?
Someone programs them! Robots are like computers where a programmer (you!) has to tell the robot everything you want it to do.

Now that you know what a robot is, you should begin building your Lego Mindstorm.  Follow the instructions found on this website: 
[Link](www.nxtprograms.com/NXT2/3-motor_chassis/steps.html) and come back to this page when you have finished!

Now that you have completed the basic model of your robot, you need to add a piece that will capture sound.  Your Lego Mindstorm kit comes 
with many different sensors which help make your robot "more intelligent". To make your robot move towards your clapping, you will use
the sound sensor.  The sound sensor looks like this:

The sound sensor is a special device that can measure sound levels up to 90 decibels (about the level of a lawnmower)!
To add the sound sensor attachment, follow these pictures:

Now attach your completed sound sensor to the front of your robot.
