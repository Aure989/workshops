<h1>Visualizing a Stack</h1>

<hr>

A stack is very similar to a queue and many of the concepts that you learned about a queue can be applied on a stack. Unlike the queue with the FIFO logic, a stack is different in that uses the opposite logic, FIFO. A common example to think about a stack is simply a stack of plates. Let's imagine a stack of 5 plates pile on top of one another. If you add a sixth plate onto the top of the stack, your stack of plates is now a stack of 6. However, what if you wanted to remove a plate? Well, you wouldn't reach to the bottom of the stack and take a plate from the bottom. You would simply just take a plate out from the top. This logic applies to stacks in Java where the Last thing in is the First to come out(LIFO).
