## Task 1: Fill an Array

<p>You are given an array of a random size and it is up to you to input numbers from 1 to n. For an example: </p>

```java

{
	//if we give you input of size 5:
	int n = 5;

    //if this is called:
	createArray(int n);

	//the new array would be created with:
	exampleArray = {1,2,3,4,5};
}

```

## Task 1: Average!

<p>Find the average values of the numbers in the array.</p>


{{%notice tip%}}
1. You can use a for loop to go through the array.
2. Reminder average = total cost / number of items.
{{%/notice%}}

<p>If we are given the array below</p>

```java

    int[] cost = {66,40,20,1,3};

    //call average function
    double avg = average(int[] arr)

    //the avege number would be
    avg = 26.0;

```

{{%/notice%}}

```java

    int[] cost = {100,90,50,60,20,1,3};
    //sorting....
    sortRestaurant(cost)

    //new cost array would be
    int[] cost = {1,3,20,50,60,90,100};
