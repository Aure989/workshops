----------------------- ------------------------------------
To begin your training in Nuevo Eats, you first must learn something called Data Structures! Here you will learn everything you need to do know for you to take on your first Nuevo Eats Mission! Lets start with the basics with what they are.

----------------------------------------------------------------

# Data Structures!

<!--- insert variety of data structures here such as ex( https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SuC2Con8--/c_imagga_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_500,q_auto,w_1000/https://res.cloudinary.com/dbvcampra/image/upload/v1588403699/Webp.net-resizeimage_5_beudao.jpg ) -->

Data strutures are super awesome and are very powerful. By using code, we can store lots of information in organized categories for use later! 
Storing items into these structures can let us access everything quickly and effectively- perfect for Nuevo Eats! Restraunts, foods, employees, and locations are just some of the examples we can use Data Structures to our advantage.

It can even store

There are many different types of data structures, just like there are many ways to organize toys!
