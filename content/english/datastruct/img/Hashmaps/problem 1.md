## Task 1: Using Hashmap to Organize data

<p>It's a party! A customer has a big birthday party for more than 20 people! Everyone has their own order. To keep the mass order organized, you decide to create a `HashMap` of strings. The birthday girl's name is Isabella, but her name is lost in the list. Can you figure out what did Isabella ordered?</p>


{{%notice tip%}}
1. Do you remember the hashmap methods?
2. Look at example order below!
{{%/notice%}}

```java

	//example of current hashmap
     HashMap<String, String> order = new HashMap<String, String, String>();

     	//key, value
    	order.put("Justin", "Sprite");
    	order.put("George", "Coke");
    	order.put("Sam", "Fanta");
    	order.put("Eva", "Coke");
    	order.put("Olivia", "Coke");
    	...
