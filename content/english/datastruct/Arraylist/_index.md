Now that the customer has access to all the items on the menu, itâ€™s time for them to place their order. A customer may want to add an item to their order, remove an item, change an item, or access an item. After finalizing the order, you want to return a receipt of the # of items that the customer ordered as well as each item in a list for the customer to checkout. We will accomplish all these feats utilizing an arraylist.
