Welcome to the course <b>Java: Basics</b>, where you will learn a widely-used high-level programming language that gives computer instructions to create exciting programs!

Java is a high-level programming language developed by James Gosling and Sun Microsystems in California in 1995. 

{{% notice info %}}
A high-level programming language is a programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer. In contrast to low-level programming languages, it may use natural language elements, be easier to use, or may automate (or evenhide entirely) significant areas of computing systems (e.g. memory management), making the process of developming a program simpler and more understandable than when using a lower-level language.
