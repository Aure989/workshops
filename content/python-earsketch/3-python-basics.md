# Python basics
To code music, we need to learn a little Python. Don't worry, it won't bite you. Python is one of the languages that we humans use to tell computers what to do. These languages are known as "programming languages". We will learn Python concepts throughout the class, but let's start with a simple print statement.

If you want to jump to a specific Python section, click on the topic
below:

-   [Print & Comments](#print-comments)
-   [Functions](#functions)

## Print & Comments
**Comments** are the parts of the code that do not get evaluated. In Python, they are preceded by the \# symbol. Anything after the \# symbol is part of the comment and is ignored by your code. Comments are put in the code to tell the readers what the code is doing. They can make maintenace of code easy and can also help in finding bugs.

**Print** statements are used to print something on the console. Use `print("Hello World")` to print *Hello World* in the output screen. We will later learn that print is a function and we use it to perform a print job. Whatever you pass to the `print` function is printed on the
screen.

Try it yourself! Write comment(s) below and add a print statement that prints *Hello World*! Don't forget to surround Hello World with quotation marks!

:::{datacamp-exercise="" lang="python"}
`                                     # This will get executed each time the exercise gets initialized                                 `{type="pre-exercise-code"}
`                                 `{type="sample-code"}
`                                     # This is a comment. Everything here will be ignored.                                     # Coders use this part to explain/maintain the code.                                     print("Hello World")                                 `{type="solution"}
`                                               test_function("print")                                 success_msg("Great work! Continue to the next section.")`{type="sct"}

::: {type="hint"}
Put the symbol (`#`) and write anything after it to create a comment.
Then use print function to print Hello World: Use
`print("Hello World")`.					

Put the symbol (`#`) and write anything after it to create a comment.
