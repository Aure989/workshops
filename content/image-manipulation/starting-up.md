Welcome!

// TODO katiewasnothere: button to repl.it

Click here to open repl.it in a new tab in your favorite browser (such as Edge, Firefox, Chrome, etc). 

In here you'll see a `main.py` file. This file contains code, or instructions for the computer to run. Anything that results from running the code will be displayed on the right side. This window is called the `console`.
