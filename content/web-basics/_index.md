# The Basics

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is one of many programming languages and it is known as the programming language for the web. It used to control website behavior, such as button clicks, pop-up windows, data flows, and many other functions.

## Variables

Variables are containers in your code that can hold a single number, word, or other information. This information can be used and changed by calling the variable later on throughout your program. This means that you are asking your program to access the information that you've stored.

With a few exceptions, variables can be named anything containing letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. BUT No matter what, they cannot have spaces and they should always start with a letter.

Variables can hold different types of data, let's go over the basic ones.

## The Data Types

### Integers

Integer is basically just a fancy name for any real number that is not a decimal. For example, integers are whole numbers like 3, 100, 6,000, -3, and so on!

```javascript
// this is a comment, these are used to describe what your code does
// Below are different examples of variables

//Integer (non decimal number) variables examples:

var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = 15;
```

### Strings

Strings are just what programmers decided to call words. If it helps remind you that strings are words, think of them as a "string" of characters. Strings can be anything like your name or the name of favorite pet.

Strings are surrounded by "quotation marks"

```javascript
//String (one or more words aka a "string" of characters) variable examples:
//string variable values are surrounded by "quotation marks"

var company = "MICROSOFT";
var course = "Coding with Micro:Bits!";
var message = "Coding is so fun!";
```

### Booleans

Sometimes programmers want to check if certain conditions are true or false. This information is stored in a Boolean data type.

If you're curious about why these are called Booleans, a guy named George Boole is the one that created them.

```javascript
//Boolean (true or false) variable example

var canPigsFly = false;
var codingIsCool = true;
```
