# Activity 3

This activity is split into 2 parts and will test your knowledge about variables.

## Activity 3.1

At the start of the game, we should tell the player how many letters the word to guess has. For example, if the word to guess is `"Hello"`, we should tell the player: `The word has 5 letters`. We have already stored the number of letters in the `numberOfLetters` variable, so use it to complete this activity.

To check if you have completed this activity correctly, press **run**, and make sure you see `The word has 5 letters` (or some number other than 5) in the console.

## Activity 3.2

There are three pieces of information that we need the computer to store:

- The number of lives.
- The number of letters that the player has guess correctly so far.
- Whether or not the player won the game.

We will declare three variables to represent these pieces of information. Press **run** to make sure no errors appear in the console. Remember that variables do not produce console output, so for this part, we are only checking for the absence of errors.
