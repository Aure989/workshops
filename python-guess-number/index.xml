You can use this in your program by writing import random at the top of your program and using the randint function to generate a number between a range.
This would generate a random number between 1 and 10
random.randint(1,10) Try running the below code a few times to see what you get!</description></item><item><title>Accept user input</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-guess-number/user-input/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-guess-number/user-input/</guid><description>Create the game This game will use some of the concepts you learned in the Python Basics section. You will need to know how to use the following concepts. If you are not familiar with any of these, please go back to review them.
